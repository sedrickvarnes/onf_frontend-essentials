i did not know a task was analyzing the website first thing, so i started refactoring it as the first thing i did, i got hold of the OG(original) version and looked at that.

html:
* it needs a <head> with the meta, title and link to the css shoud also have a charset.
* instead of a div with cass header i switched it to a header to get the proper semantics elemen, the class be the same 
* i changed from a div element to a nav element  
* added a main element with articals insted of 1000 div's within the main it is not div's  but artical. 

css:
* added a nav class css to style the buttons 
* deleted content img and puttet a styling for the img as img
* from line 67 to 100 or last of element element:focus and down is new written code
